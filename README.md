# Definition-Inserter
A Chrome Extension that inserts definitions of highlighted words in-line.

This project was created as part of Cypher VI, a William & Mary hackathon. 

### Installation 
Because we require host permissions, this chrome extension needs substantial review from Google. Right now, to run it in your browser, the only option right now is download this github repo as zip, unzip it, go to `chrome://extensions`,  and `load unpacked` 

### Usage
Once you've highlighted a word you're unsure about, a tooltip will pop up allowing you to insert its definition or add it to your to-study list.

### Hotkeys
Alt+A - Automatically insert the definition
Alt+S - Automatically save the word to a to-study list
