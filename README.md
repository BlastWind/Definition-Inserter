# Definition-Inserter
A Chrome Extension that inserts definitions of highlighted words in-line.

This project was created as part of Cypber VI, a William & Mary hackathon. 

### Installation 
We are still working on distributing the Chrome Extension. To run it in your browser, the only option right now is to go to `chrome://extensions`, download this github repo, and `load unpacked` this repo!

### Usage
Once you've highlighted a word you're unsure about, a tooltip will pop up allowing you to insert its definition or add it to your to-study list.

### Hotkeys
Alt+A - Automatically insert the definition
Alt+S - Automatically save the word to a to-study list
